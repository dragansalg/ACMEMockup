    <div>We at ACME belive in efficiency, by using Scrum we make our team effective and motivated!</div>
    <div>One might ask, what in the world is Scrum?</div><br>
    <div class="myDiv"><h1>Scrum:</h1>
        <p>Development can be crazy and a way to make it less so is by using scrum.<br>
        This is a way to increase group productivity by making a clear schedule.<br>
        We plan how to work with eachother, divide the project into small tasks and decide when we will work with what.<br>
        We let each member pick up whichever task nobody else is working on.<br> 
        When done with a task, make sure to check in with other members of the team to see if they are up to schedule and if they need any help.</p>
